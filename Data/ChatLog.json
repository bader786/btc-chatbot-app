It appears that there's a service called HEY, which is a rethinking of email and calendar, offering a fresh take on traditional email and calendar systems. According to the search results, HEY uses a unique approach with features like a \"Screener\" for emails, a modern calendar, and a simplified reintroduction of email. If you're curious, you can check out their website to learn more about how it works. Additionally, there's a YouTube video with the title \"Hey\" by the Backstreet Boys, but I'm assuming that's not what you're looking for right now!"

    "content": "You want a Python code to build a clock. There are several ways to do this, but I'll provide you with a simple example using Tkinter, which is a built-in Python library for creating GUI applications.\n\nHere's a code snippet that creates a digital clock:\n```python\nimport time\nimport tkinter as tk\n\ndef update_time():\n    current_time = time.strftime(\"%H:%M:%S\")\n    clock_label.config(text=current_time)\n    root.after(1000, update_time)\n\nroot = tk.Tk()\nroot.title(\"Digital Clock\")\n\nclock_label = tk.Label(root, font=('times', 20, 'bold'), bg='white')\nclock_label.pack(fill='both', expand=1)\n\nupdate_time()\nroot.mainloop()\n```\nThis code creates a window with a label that displays the current time in the format \"HH:MM:SS\". The `update_time` function is called every 1000 milliseconds (1 second) to update the time display.\n\nIf you want to avoid using Tkinter, you can use the following code to print the current time to the console:\n```python\nimport time\n\nwhile True:\n    current_time = time.strftime(\"%H:%M:%S\")\n    print(current_time, end='\\r')\n    time.sleep(1)\n```\nThis code uses a `while` loop to continuously print the current time to the console, updating every second. The `\\r` character is used to overwrite the previous line, creating a simple digital clock effect.\n\nNote that the second example will run indefinitely until you stop the program."
